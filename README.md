# Background
Lee, an online personal counselor, helps employees who struggle with feelings of mild anxiety or loneliness while working from home. Rather than cope alone, they talk with Lee to destress.

“You’re lonely?” Lee might say. “I’m sorry about that. Can you tell me more about how you’re feeling?”

Those words might not seem surprising from a human. But Lee is an AI-powered cognitive chatbot, and the latest creation of the Applied AI Studio, a collaboration of DXC Technology and Drexel University’s College of Computing and Informatics.

The cognitive chatbot project that developed Lee began this past April. We realized that some remote employees, many of whom were working at home for the first time as a result of recent physical distancing and stay-at-home guidelines, might be suffering from anxiety and mild stress. To help, we came up with the idea of creating a mental-health counseling chatbot.

“It is not always feasible for people to visit a therapist,” explains Hemanth Ariktala, an Applied AI Studio Information Engineer and the chatbot project’s product owner. “Our challenge was to make mental health support much more accessible with the help of a digital human bot.”

To create the bot, a small team from the Applied AI Studio worked with Dr. George Mathew, DXC’s chief medical officer, and two Drexel University psychologists to create a series of chatbot scripts.

One of the academics was Dr. Adrienne Juarascio, an assistant professor of psychology at Drexel, who has studied the use of digital technology to provide just-in-time interventions for people suffering from depression, anxiety and eating disorders. “Getting resources to as many people as we can during this pandemic is a top priority,” she says.

To do this, the team drew on research around the most common issues, known as “intents,” such as anxiety, loneliness, insomnia and guilt. Then the Applied AI Studio team mapped the AI component of their chatbot to these intents. They also drew on research showing that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered over the internet can be as effective as therapy delivered face-to-face, especially for relatively mild problems such as anxiety and stress.

ee was inspired by what we were experiencing with the pandemic; however, supporting mental-health and remote work isn’t limited to our current situation. Mental health services, whether in-person or made more widely available by an AI, is an ongoing need.  And it is a need that can be met swiftly by AI. We completed our entire chatbot project in just 12 weeks. As we tackle other moonshot projects with customers in our Applied AI Studio, watch this space to learn about the transformative power of AI.

# The Idea

## The Problem
Our idea falls under the theme of financial confidence and education. The global pandemic has affected us all. Feelings of isolation, depression and anxiety are on the rise. The spread of COVID-19 has caused a global economic recession. We can help you be there for customers struggling with these issues.

## The Solution
Our solution is to build an artificial intelligence that listens and makes helpful suggestions. More than just FAQ, the AI will be programmed to engage on emotional issues like stress and isolation. But it will also make practical suggestions. We'll include a budget optimizer that searches for creative ways to make ends meet for people experiencing hardship.

### The Impact
This kind of support is no longer optional.  Customers expect businesses to find new ways to connect with them online. We can help you exceed those expectations and build new bonds with all customers that have been affected by the pandemic.
